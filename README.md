# NLP-Projects

This repository contains solutions for my **Automated Knowledge Base Construction** projects completed during my Masterâ€™s degree in 2022. The project involves extracting structured information from unstructured text using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, such as named entity recognition (NER), relation extraction, and language model probing.

## Features:
- **NLP-based relation extraction** using SpaCy
- **Probing of language models** (e.g., BERT) to predict relations between entities (e.g., profession, language spoken).
- **Data processing and filtering** using Pandas to handle large datasets and select relevant results based on defined probability thresholds.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.7+
- Required libraries: `spacy`, `torch`, `transformers`, `pandas`, `argparse`, etc.
